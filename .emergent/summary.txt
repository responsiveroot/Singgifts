The trajectory outlines the development of a Singapore-themed e-commerce website, SingGifts, from scratch. The initial user request specified a complex tech stack (Next.js, Shopify, etc.), which the AI engineer correctly identified as unsupported and negotiated a switch to the platform's native FastAPI, React, and MongoDB stack.

The development process was highly iterative, driven by frequent and critical user feedback. The initial phase involved setting up the full-stack architecture, including the backend API, database models, and a complete set of frontend pages (Home, Product, Cart, etc.). A seeding script was created to populate the database with initial data.

However, the core of the work revolved around multiple, intensive redesigns of the homepage. The user was repeatedly dissatisfied with the visual appeal and layout, providing examples like KrisShop and Flipkart as inspiration. The AI engineer responded by:
1.  Redesigning the layout from a simple page to a professional e--commerce portal.
2.  Completely changing the product categories multiple times based on user input.
3.  Implementing specific UI features like unique horizontal category banners and product sliders with arrows.
4.  Continuously refining colors, animations, and component styling to meet the user's demand for a premium and stunning look.

The last interaction confirmed that all 20 new categories were correctly displayed on the homepage, concluding a major UI overhaul. The primary language of the user is English, and all future responses should be in English.

<product_requirements>
The objective is to build SingGifts, a fully functional, responsive, and visually appealing e-commerce website targeting the Singapore market. The site must have a premium, modern, and clean aesthetic, inspired by Singaporean culture.

**Core Features Implemented:**
- **Technology Stack**: FastAPI backend, React frontend, and MongoDB database.
- **Homepage**: A highly-customized homepage featuring a hero banner, a grid of 20 product categories, each with a unique colorful horizontal banner, and a product slider with navigation arrows.
- **Product & Category System**: The database has been seeded with 20 specific categories (e.g., Batik, Chocolates, Tea) and 6 sample products per category.
- **Core Pages**: The application structure includes pages for Products, Product Details, Cart, Checkout, Authentication (Google/Email), Deals, and a User Dashboard.
- **Authentication**: A hybrid system allowing both Google social login and custom email/password with OTP was planned.

**Pending High-Level Requirements:**
- **AI-Powered Features**: Integration of an AI Chat Assistant, semantic search, and AI-based product recommendations.
- **CMS Backend**: An editable, drag-and-drop style backend to manage all page sections (hero, categories, products, banners).
- **Deals Page & Flash Sales**: The Deals page exists, but the Flash Sale section on the homepage was explicitly flagged by the user as very basic and old and needs a redesign.
- **Mega-Menu**: A dropdown menu with images for each category needs to be implemented.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack Architecture**: FastAPI (Python) for the backend, React.js for the frontend.
- **Database**: MongoDB, managed and populated via a Python seeding script ().
- **Frontend Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and custom CSS for specific features like hiding scrollbars.
- **Routing**:  for client-side navigation between pages.
- **UI Components**: Use of custom React components.  is used for toast notifications.
- **Asynchronous Operations**:  in both the Python backend (with ) and JavaScript frontend ().
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard monorepo structure with separate  and  directories.



- ****
  - **Importance**: This is the core of the backend, defining all API endpoints using FastAPI. It handles requests for products, categories, deals, authentication, and AI features.
  - **Changes**: The file was created to serve all necessary data for the e-commerce platform. It connects to the MongoDB database and serves data based on Pydantic models.

- ****
  - **Importance**: This script is critical for setting up and iterating on the website's content. It populates the MongoDB database with categories, products, and deals.
  - **Changes**: This file has been modified extensively. Initially, it seeded a few generic categories. It was later updated to 13 categories from user images, and finally to the current 20 specific gift categories. It now also seeds unique image URLs and banner colors for each category.

- ****
  - **Importance**: This is the main entry point for the React application's components. It sets up the application's routing using , defining which component to render for each URL path.
  - **Changes**: It was modified to render the new  component for the root path () instead of the original , reflecting the major homepage redesign.

- ****
  - **Importance**: This is the current, active homepage component and the most heavily modified file in the project. It is responsible for the entire visual layout and user experience of the landing page.
  - **Changes**: This file was created from scratch to replace the original basic homepage. It has undergone multiple major redesigns to incorporate:
    - A carousel-style hero banner.
    - Unique, colorful, horizontal banners for all 20 categories.
    - A product slider with navigation arrows for each category section.
    - Responsive design adjustments for product images.
    - Code to fetch and display products for each of the 20 categories.

- ****
  - **Importance**: This file contains global CSS styles and Tailwind CSS directives.
  - **Changes**: It was modified to add custom CSS to hide the horizontal scrollbar for the product sliders, creating a cleaner look for the slider component.

<pending_tasks>
- Redesign the Flash Sale Section on the homepage, which the user found very basic and old.
- Implement the AI-powered features: Chat Assistant, Semantic Search, and Product Recommendations.
- Build the mega-menu with images corresponding to each category.
- Develop the drag-and-drop CMS backend for content editing.
- Finalize the authentication flow, particularly the Email/OTP part.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing the user's concern about missing categories on the homepage. The user asked, Where are the Tea, Wedgwood Fine Bone China, Wax Bar categories. The engineer confirmed these categories were present but were located at the bottom of the page, requiring the user to scroll down.

To prove this, the engineer took two consecutive screenshots:
1.  The first screenshot showed the categories that were further down the page.
2.  The second screenshot specifically captured the final three categories (, , ) at the very bottom of the homepage.

The work concluded by confirming that all 20 requested categories are successfully implemented and visible on the live preview URL, each featuring a unique colorful banner and a product slider with arrows. The application is in a visually complete state regarding the homepage category layout, pending further user feedback or work on other sections.

<optional_next_step>
Based on your previous feedback, I will now completely redesign the Flash Sale section on the homepage to make it more modern, dynamic, and visually appealing, aligning it with the quality of a premium e-commerce portal.
